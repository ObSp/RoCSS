RoCSS utilizes Roblox's `CollectionService` to obtain a table of GUI elements it should apply certain styles to.

<h2>Tagging Elements</h2>
To let RoCSS know that it should apply a style to a certain GUI element, we have to add a `Tag` to the object. To add a `tag` to an instance, scroll down in the 
`Properties` window until you see the `Tags` section. Then, click on the `+` icon to add a tag to it. This `tag` should be the name of the `class` you wish the `element`
to be a part of.
